# A cave description of Vrtnarija, Sistem Migovec, Tolminski Migovec, Slovenia

This document is a cave description of *Vrtnarija*, part of the *Migovec System*.

Pitch lengths are approximate, from inspecting the line survey. Description is
from memory, by Jarvist Moore Frost.

## General



## Entrance to Pico (-125 m)

# Caeserien section (P6), Andy's Pitch (P6), Gardener's World (P7), Laurel (P30)

The entrance is an obvious depression in the North-Eastern flank of the Migovec
plateau, facing the 'Whale bone' and Skrbino. 

The entrance chamber has a loose rock floor, leading to a drop down behind
a boulder on the left and a narrow crawl with a step down, leading to the
chamber below Oh-so-fag-arse.

Here you avoid the direct descent of the tight rift (*Birth Canal*) and instead
traverse along to the pitch (*Caeserien Section*). Rift is tight at the top, with
an immediate deviation.

The rope directly leads to a Y-hang (*Andy's Pitch*) which can also be completed
by a climb down a widening rift on the left.

You are now at a number of large boulders in a 3m wide rift. The next pitch (*Gardener's World*) has
loose rock near the top, and a suspended Y-hang landing in the wide rift.
Walking ~10m on arrives at the Y-hang window onto *Laurel* (P30).

A short pitch in a narrow (and drippy) section leads to a ledge above the main
pitch, which is then descended (~30m) to a large ledge above *Jelly Chamber* and
a small pitch. The main hang in Laurel is always drippy, and becomes wet (but
more like rain, rather than a stream) in wet weather.

### I-Scream Series to Pico

From Jelly Chamber (bottom of Laurel), climb down through the floor below a large rock, down a wet rock face, into: 
the Urinal Series [*I Scream* (P10), *You Scream* (P10), *Rope Climb* (P2), *We Scream* (P10), *Piston* (P20)],
5 short pitches following a small stream. 

The I-Scream series have tight, awkward, tackle-bag grabbing,
rift pitch heads. *Piston* is a nice open pitch, with a traverse step across the
rift to a shelf on the far side, and then a deviation in the continuing expanding rift. 
The bottom of the *Piston* is wet in heavy
weather conditions, as the stream richochets off the fall wall.

## Pico to Pink

*Pico* (P60m) is the start of the main pitch series. It is a sloping pitch with
~12 rebelays. The route starts as a roped traverse across the edge of the rock bridge
you have been walking along. A few rebelays down, there is a route which swings
off to the right (facing the pitch) leading to the window into *Captain
Kangaroo*. In extremely wet weather, a waterfall enters *Pico* from a hole in the
ceiling, and lands on a ledge a few rebelays above the bottom. *Pico* becomes
fairly wet in a rain storm, but is still passable.

Below *Pico*, there are two short rift-pitches (*Terra* and *Nova*) which are near
the stream, but always dry. This is the last place to get water to drink until
*Concorde* (-400 m).

A rift leads to the *Swing* pitchhead, which abseils down and then joins
a tension traverse first along the wall, then up a muddy slope. A short bit of rift passage reaches *Tesselator*. The pitch head is tight, and is best attempted carefully, clipping off tackle to the traverse line to be retrieved once setup for abseiling down the pitch.

*Tesselator* is two completely dry muddy pitches (hangs of XX m and YY m) split by a ledge chamber.

*Space Odyssey* starts with a tight pitch head and immediate deviation, for a XX
hang to a large clean washed ledge. There is then a tensioned traverse out
across a drop (into which a small stream enters) before another Y-hang and
descent to *Concorde* (P80).

*Concorde* has four rebelays of ~20 m. There is a little trickle of a stream at
the bottom, which makes for a nice drinking spot.

*Alchemy* has an awkward rope-protected clamber down to a ledge and then a ~20
m hang.

The climb up into *Zlatarog rift* requires care, particularly with heavy tackle.
There is a tiny ~3 m pitch to gain an alcove for the main ~20 m descent. 

*Fistful of Tolars* is a fine pitch with two rebelays, after the initial descent
from the wall & large deviation pulling it away.

Clambering up the boulder slope (not following the stream to the unrigged
and mostly unpushed *Banzai Streamway*), you can duck under the boulder on the
left and short abseil to a boulder covered slope (care required if people are
below you), to a tensioned traverse to the short *Pink pitch*.

## Pink to Friendship
